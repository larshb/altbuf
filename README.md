altbuf
======

Tiny package to enter and exit the alterante buffer using ANSI escape sequences.
There is no need to use ncurses or other legacy packages to do one simple thing,
which is to open a separate terminal buffer (window) temporarily, and return the
terminal to its previous state afterwards.

Tested and working in PowerShell and Gnome-Terminal.
